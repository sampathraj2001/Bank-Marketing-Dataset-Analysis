## Introduction
This project aims to analyze the Bank Marketing dataset, perform EDA, preprocess data, build machine learning models, and compare their performance.

## Dataset
The dataset was provided by my tutor for educational purposes. The original source is unknown, and therefore the dataset is not included in this repository. 

## EDA
- Handling missing values
- Checking correlations
- Encoding categorical variables
- Type conversion
- Feature selection
- Feature scaling
- Data balancing

## Data Preprocessing
Details of the data preprocessing steps taken before model building.

## Model Building
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## Hyperparameter Tuning
Fine-tuning the parameters of the models for optimal performance.

## Model Performance Comparison
Comparing the performance of the three models using various metrics.

## Conclusion
Summary of the findings and final remarks.
